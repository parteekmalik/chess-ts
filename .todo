Machine Learning 
    -> create training data sets
    -> three outputs buy, sell, nothing in sigmoids
    
ANALYTICS
    -> research on charts trading related
    -> make it a grid for all charts and make it better


add margin trading
    -> borrow money
    -> repayment
    -> intrest
    -> watch for liquidation

add tradeing fees and widrawal and other transections
    -> make fees adjustable for users

DB
    -> make Pin0 and Pin1 combine(can add more than 2 pins) and remove from redux use trpc(react-query for store data)
    -> make a setting propertie in trading account

Spot 
    -> make timeframe of chart store in DB
    -> save layout for example ratio of positions and chart (will add more in future)
    -> make a price strip moving right -> left with price or static (make settings for it)
    -> make layout customizeable and user can adjust to their preference (store in trading account settings)
    -> make all tables for horizontal and vertical cards
    watchList

OrderBook details
    Positions
        -> sort posotions by totalPrice of asset
        -> on hover asset show current totalprice and bought totalprice

Backend
    -> (fix) sell limit completed instantly
    -> a better approach to syncing orders data
    -> refactor codebase and reorganize
    -> when order completes update price too
